		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>I'm a second year Games Technology student at the University of the West of England.</p>

		<h1>Game Level Design</h1>
		<h2>What the role entails:</h2>
		<p>When you play games, think about what keeps you wanting to play more. Is it the environment? The way the character 
		interacts with the world around it? Think about what makes a game interesting and exciting to play. This is the job 
		of a level designer. The process begins by sketching ideas out and thinking about how to best approach the level in 
		terms of how the player could act, and all the possibilties of this. The game needs to flow well, with a clear path 
		mapped out but one that is not forcing the player through a narrow path that will inevitably become boring. They need 
		to think about how to get the player to intuitively trigger the events that allows the game to progress, without 
		making it too easy or too obscure.</p>
		<h3>A level designer should:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>be able to come up with creative ways of adding missions and challenges to a game.</li>
			<li>have a good understanding of gameplay mechanics and be able to see all possibilities in terms of what the player could do, even when acting unpredictably.</li>
			<li>be able to use scripting languages and understand the basics of gameplay programming.</li>
			<li>have a basic understanding of physics and be able to accurately predict how objects will move within the game when the laws of physics are applied.</li>
			<li>have developed 2D and 3D design skills and be able to use software such as Maya to create 3D environments.</li>
			<li>be able to communicate well with other areas of the team such as the artists and design team. They will most likely work alongside the gameplay designers, gameplay testers, as well as the artists and programmers.</li>
		</ul>
